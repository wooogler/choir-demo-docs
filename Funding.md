# Funding Support for Conference Attendance

- Our lab provides funding support for travel to major conferences such as CHI, UIST, and CSCW if the student is the first author presenting a paper or poster. Due to limited lab funding, support is restricted to these specific conferences.
- Additionally, if a conference is nearby, the professor may be able to support travel for the student to gain valuable experience, even if the student is not the first author presenting a paper or poster.
