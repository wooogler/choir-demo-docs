# Funding Support for Conference Attendance

- Our lab provides funding support for conference attendance if the student is the first author presenting a paper or poster.
- Additionally, if a conference is held nearby, there may be opportunities for professors to support travel expenses for students to gain valuable experience, even if they are not the first author presenting a paper or poster.
