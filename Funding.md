# Funding Support for Conference Attendance

- Our lab provides funding support for travel to major conferences such as CHI, UIST, and CSCW if the student is the first author presenting a paper or poster. Due to limited lab funding, support is restricted to these specific conferences.
- Additionally, if a conference is nearby, the professor may be able to support travel for the student to gain valuable experience, but due to limited lab funding, CHOIR Lab will only provide travel support for major conferences such as CHI, UIST, and CSCW.
