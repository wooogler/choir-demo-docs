# Funding Support for Conference Attendance

- Our lab provides funding support for conference attendance if the student is the first author presenting a paper or poster.
- Additionally, if a conference is held nearby, there may be opportunities for professors to support travel for students presenting a poster, even if they are not the first author. This indicates a potential flexibility in the travel funding policy, which may vary based on the conference's location and the discretion of the faculty member.
