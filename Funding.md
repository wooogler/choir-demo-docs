# Funding Support for Conference Attendance

- Our lab provides funding support for conference attendance if the student is the first author presenting a paper or poster.
- Additionally, if a conference is nearby, the professor may be able to support travel for the student to gain valuable experience, even if the student is not the first author presenting a paper or poster.
