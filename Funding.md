# Funding Support for Conference Attendance

- Our lab provides funding support for conference attendance if the student is the first author presenting a paper or poster.
- Additionally, if a conference is nearby, professors may offer support for travel expenses for students presenting a poster, even if they are not the first author. This opportunity is aimed at enhancing the students' experience and exposure in their respective fields.
