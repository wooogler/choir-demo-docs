# Ph.D. in Computer Science: Program Guide for Current Students

## Degree requirements

To earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, students must fulfill the following:

- Total Credits: Minimum of 90 graduate-level credits.
- Coursework: At least 27 credits from approved, letter-graded courses.
- Research: Sufficient credits of CS 7994 (Research & Dissertation) to meet the 90-credit total (minimum of 30 credits).
- GPA: Minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 in all graduate coursework.
- Examinations: Completion of the Qualifying Exam, Preliminary Exam, and Final Defense.
- Timeline:  4–5 years, depending on prior degrees.

### Coursework requirements (27 graded credits)

To fulfill the 27-credit coursework requirement, students must:

- Fulfil the Breadth Requirement: Complete one course in at least four distinct areas, including Area 0 (Ethics). [View approved breadth area courses »](https://students.cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Courses.html)
- CS Courses: Take at least 6 CS courses at the 5000 or 6000 level, including at least 2 courses at the 6000 level. Students can take a max of 6 credits of 4000-level CS courses and only if approved for graduate credit.
- [Cognate Course](https://students.cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Courses/CognateCourses.html): Take 1 approved non-CS course relevant to your research.
- Additional Requirements: CS 5944: Graduate Seminar (2 semesters, 1 credit each)

## Ph.D. Degree Milestones

Ph.D. students are expected to complete all degree requirements within 5 years of entering the program. Timely progress through key milestones is essential to maintain good academic standing and eligibility for funding.

### Timelines and Progress
- Completion within 5 years: Students must complete the Ph.D. within five years. This is the standard timeframe for satisfactory academic progress.
- Beyond 5 Years: Students who do not complete the degree within five years must submit a detailed degree completion plan to the Director of Graduate Programs to continue in the program.
- Funding Implications: Departmental funding (GTA, GRA, GA) is not guaranteed and is unlikely for students who exceed the 5-year limit.

### Impact of Missing Milestones
Failure to meet established milestones—such as forming a committee, passing exams, or submitting the Plan of Study—indicates a lack of satisfactory progress. This may result in:

- Ineligibility for assistantship or departmental funding
- Academic hold that prevents registration
- Academic probation or dismissal from the program

Students are responsible for knowing and meeting all deadlines. Consult with your advisor and the Graduate Program Coordinator regularly to stay on track.

### Milestone and Deadline
By the end of the first year, students are expected to select an advisor. The plan of study should be submitted by the end of the third semester. The qualifying exam must be passed by the end of the second year. The preliminary exam is typically taken in the fourth year and must be completed at least six months before the final defense. Students should apply for their degree at the beginning of their final semester in the fifth year. The Electronic Thesis or Dissertation (ETD) should be submitted after a successful final defense.

## Ph.D. Advisory Commitee
The Advisory Committee plays a central role in guiding your academic progress, research development, and degree completion. Forming this committee early in your Ph.D. program is essential to ensure timely progress through key milestones.

- Total Members: At least five members. Ph.D. advisory committee must have five members by the time that the preliminary exam is scheduled.  An initial plan of study can be submitted with only four members of the committee identified. At least three members must hold tenure-track or emeritus positions in the Department of Computer Science.

- Chair/Advisor: Must be a tenure-track or tenured CS faculty member, or hold a courtesy or emeritus appointment.

- External Member: At least one member from outside the CS@VT Department.  The external member must be approved prior to adding them to the committee.

Contact your Graduate Program Coordinator to initiate the approval process.

- Graduate School Approval: All members must be pre-approved by the Graduate School. Current [List of Approved Committee Members](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vw7cWTG1Q1AQxXUTLhnXkROVV0bzzLK-uedaEyfc9H0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Examination Timeline
You must be registered during the term you take each exam. Follow the steps by the dates and deadlines shared by the Graduate School

- The Qualifying Exam is intended to assess the student’s readiness for research and is typically taken in the first or second year. It is usually scheduled in the spring semester, between February and March.

- The Preliminary Exam is designed to review the student’s research proposal and is recommended to be completed in the fourth year, at least six months prior to the final defense. To schedule the exam, students must submit the necessary information through the Graduate School’s Signature Approval System at least two weeks in advance.

- The Final Defense is the formal presentation and defense of the completed dissertation. It is generally held in the fifth year during the final semester. The exam must be scheduled at least two weeks in advance and submitted through the Signature Approval System with full approval from the entire committee.
